# Anify-API
JavaScript API server for scraping anime and manga sites.

## Scraping
Anify API scrapes numerous anime and manga sites, from Zoro, to GogoAnime, to AnimePahe, and more. The API is built on top of [AniSync](https://github.com/Eltik/AniSync) to map AniList information to streaming sites, allowing for multiple providers in case one ever goes down. To avoid rate limits, the API also caches data for a set amount of time and retrieves it when necessary.

- [x] [Zoro](https://zoro.to)
